# SK-Framework v0.1

## Description

This project is a little MVC-framework made for educational purposes


There are currently several test controllers, views, and models in the project. I will remove them in the future.


## A brief overview of the structure


```
- public/index.php - the main script that accepts requests

- vendor/core - core of the framework
-- vendor/core/base - base controller, moldel and view
-- vendor/core/Db.php - connection to DB
-- vendor/core/Router.php - router

- vendor/libs - external libs
-- vendor/libs/helpers - some classes with help methods

- app - application (controllers, models, views)

- config - configuration of the application (parameters of the DB connection)

```
